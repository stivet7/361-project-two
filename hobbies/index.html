    <p>As far as hobbies are concerned I have 3 main hobbies, which are sleeping, video games and figure collecting.
I do a lot of my sleeping during the weekend since I don't have classes on Fridays. I spend my Fridays at work
and I almost always get home tired so its easier to fall asleep. I also fell into the habit of sleeping between or after classes
senior year of high school when I would immediately sleep for 2-3 hours after getting home from school because it was Friday.
For video games I tend to play fighting and action games with the two main games I've been playing being Overwatch
and Marvel vs. Capcom: Infinite. I usually play on weekends due to school and work, but during the summer is when I play the most with friends on Xbox One.</p>

    <p>Another hobby of mine is collecting action figures, specifically those of the Transformers and Power Rangers lines. I started collecting about 5 years ago
but it didn't take a specific direction until late 2016. By that I mean that I had been collecting figures from various series from the lines and not
having a focuses outside of just having the figures. For the Transformers I decided to collect figures that were released under the Classics/Universe/Generations
lines as well as the current Studio Series line. For Power Rangers, it's a mix of the current Legacy figure line, Japanese 2011 Gokaiger line and Megazords
and morphers from different seasons. In addition to collecting I also customize some of the figures, this widdles down to adding silver or gold paint applications
using 4 different paint pens. I only really do this if the figures are in need of it for the sake of on screen accuracy.</p>
